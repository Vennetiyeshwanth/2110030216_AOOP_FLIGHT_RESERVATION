Online Airline reservation system maintains the information about the passengers present in the flight, 
 the number of tickets issued.
Booking tickets manually is a very complex task. The Online Airline reservation system has been 
designed to computerize and automate the operations performed over the information about the passengers, 
issues and canceling and all other operations. This computerization of Airline reservation system
 helps to reduce the workload of passengers as most of the manual work is automated.
